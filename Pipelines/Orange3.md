# Orange3 workflow pipelines

## Installation of Orange3

There are a number of options for installing Orange3 ready for the session.

1. Download and install the program on your machine directly from this link:
https://orangedatamining.com/download/#windows (make sure you choose the *standalone installer* for your operating system).
Note: this will also install MiniConda and if you are a python user, take care if you change the defaults for python PATHS.

2. If you don't want to install it on your PC but still want to use it for the session, there is the option to launch from a folder (i.e. without installing). The option to do this is available from the same link, but click 'Portable Orange': https://orangedatamining.com/download/#windows 
Once downloaded, unzip the folder. You can do this by right-clicking and selecting 'Extract All'. I find Windows built-in unzip system to be unreliable. If you have issues, I would recommend using 7Zip to extract it. (7Zip available here: https://www.7-zip.org/).
Note: I have not tested this on a Mac. I *believe* you should also be able to unzip and run from the folder.

3. If all of this strikes fear into you (firstly, don't panic!) - I will have the program available on a USB which you can copy onto your machine. This will be the result of option 2, but for those unsure about unzipping folders or having issues with the extraction process. If you do want to borrow the USB to copy the folder onto your machine, *please let me know on Day 1 of the workshops or first thing on Day 2*.
